Cloud-based chat using your WordPress accounts. Minnit uses SSO to allow you and your WordPress users to communicate with one another. Chats take place on our servers, so you don't have to worry about messy installations or unnecessary server usage.

== Description ==
Minnit Chat is an easy-to-use group chat service. You can appoint moderators to watch over your chat, customize the look and feel of your chat, and increase engagement by having your users be able to talk to one another in real time!

Configure the chatroom to use Single Sign-On, and users who load the chat will automatically be logged in using their WordPress accounts. No need for additional sign-ups, onboarding, or any other steps â€” your users can get chatting right away!

Many other features can be enabled or disabled, including support for sending GIFs, uploading files, direct messaging between users, and more.

Get started in minutes and get chatting with Minnit!

== Installation ==
Once this plugin is installed, you will be able to add a Minnit Chat to any post or page using the editor. Simply create a new block, scroll down to "Embeds", and then select "Minnit Chat". Enter your chat name, and you're all set!

Want a site-wide icon? No problem. Simply go to the Settings section of your WordPress admin panel, and then select Minnit Chat. Once you enter a chat name and customize the color/position, the icon will appear on every page on your site, so your users can instantly start chatting.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How many users can join my chat? =
 
Up to 20 users can connect at once on the Free tier. If you expect more users, you can consider subscribing to a monthly or annual subscription.
 
= Can I change the background or colors? =
 
Yes. These options and more are available via "Chat Settings" from within your chatroom itself. Upload a background image, change the color scheme, set up light or dark mode, and more.

= Can I ban users from the chat, or remove messages? =

Yes. Clicking a user will allow you to ban them. You can also tap and hold a message, or click the three dots next to it, to delete an individual message. 

= Can I appoint moderators? =

Yes. Moderators can ban users and remove messages, but you retain full control and are able to add or remove moderators as desired.

= Does this increase my server costs or bandwidth? =

No. The chat and content within are hosted on our servers; messages are not stored on your server, and connections are not established with your server.

= Can users use their existing accounts to chat? =

Yes. Set up Single Sign-On within the plugin settings to get started. Once configured, users will be able to chat right away using their same name and photo (if present) from your WordPress site.

== Screenshots ==
1. Talk directly with visitors of your site in real time using Minnit.
2. Minnit seamlessly and securely connects with WordPress accounts using SSO. Names and pictures automatically populate in the chat, reducing friction for users and ensuring a smooth experience.
3. Customize your chatroom with a variety of options, to make everything work exactly how you see fit.
4. A variety of settings allows you to pick who is allowed to use the chatroom, and how the chatroom should behave.
5. Adding a chatroom to a single post is a breeze. Simply add the "Minnit Chat" block, enter your chat URL, and you're all set.

== Changelog ==
= 4.0.6 =
Version 4.0.6 of the plugin is here, with a behind-the-scenes change: When generating SSO tokens, we now make a request where the "minnitpage" URL parameter is used, rather than the more generic "p". This will ensure the chatroom will correctly operate, without conflicting with other potential plugins.

= 4.0.5 =
Removes `min-width` from the chatroom frame, so if the chat is embedded on a very small div, it will remain confined to the parent dimensions.

= 4.0.3 =
